Guidelines:
- When wanting to add your notebook changes, 
  it could be useful to save and quit notebooks, 
  to confirm that the right changes are going to be 
  staged and not an earlier version of your work

- Please don't change the diamonds.csv file, should 
  we need a different database we will save it under 
  a different name. This isn't a huge issue as rolling 
  back the db should be simple enough.
